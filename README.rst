**Mimical (Modelling the Intensity of Multiply-Imaged Celestial Ancient Light)**


Mimical is an intensity modelling code for multiply-imaged objects, performing simultaenous Bayseian inference of model parameters via the nested sampling algorithm. Mimical supports any astropy model, and supports user defined parameter polynomial depenency with image wavelength.
